# Today's Assignment

Read About the History of General Artificial Intelligence Research, the future of AGI, and modern AI safety concerns. Write down your thoughts in the form of two-three questions you would ask your classmates. Please review the following resources:

* [History of Artificial Intelligence](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/)

> * What's the nature of the chasm between today's Machine Learning and general Artificial Intelligence?
> * How does the state of the industry cross that chasm?
> * Are there any useful "expert systems" methods applicable to modern Machine Learning?

* [How far-are we from achieving artificial general intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/06/10/how-far-are-we-from-achieving-artificial-general-intelligence/#e8aa1876dc4d)

> * Do you feel that artificial intelligence is a threat? (widely exceeding its benefits?)
> * Do we need to achieve general artificial intelligence?  Should it be a research goal?

* [Humans Fascination with artificial general intellgience](https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/ai-machine-learning/humans-fascination-with-artificial-general-intelligence/a/d-id/1334885) 


* [Risks from Articial Intelligence](https://www.cser.ac.uk/research/risks-from-artificial-intelligence/) 

> * Does increased intellgience necessarily mean threatening?  (Are humans who are at the high end of the intelligence distribution necessarily more threatening than those near the mean?)

* [AI Safety Concerns](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/9/18174081/fhi-govai-ai-safety-american-public-worried-ai-catastrophe)

> * Why or how would bias and inequality be big issues as AI becomes more powerful? Wouldn't systems that are biased or result in unequal outcomes be considered deficient or more error prone than systems with lower bias and more equitable outcomes?

* [Pascal's Mugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRuNA2eK7w0)

> * I don't understand how Pascal's Wager/Mugging applies to GAI?
> * How can societly realistically stop or curb GAI research?

* [Yann LeCunn Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSOCuByo24)
